# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Problem Statement
A telecom company is experiencing customer churn, leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. You have been tasked as a data analyst to analyze customer demographics, billing patterns, and service usage to uncover key drivers of churn. The insights you generate will help the company develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.

## üìå Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical concern for telecom companies, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this projectI will be analyzing the Telco customer dataset to understand the factors influencing churn and derive actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

## üéØ Objectives
-	Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
-	Analyze customer demographics and service usage to find patterns.
-	Determine the impact of contract types, tenure, and monthly charges on churn.
-	Assess how payment methods and internet services influence churn.
-	Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer;
```

2.	Find the percentage of customers who churned based on gender.
```sql
SELECT 
	gender,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer
GROUP BY gender
```

3.	Analyze the churn rate based on senior citizen status.
```sql
SELECT 
	CASE 
		WHEN SeniorCitizen = 1 THEN 'Senior Citizen'
		ELSE 'Non Senior Citizen'
		END Citizen_Status
		,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer
GROUP BY seniorcitizen
```

4.	Determine the average tenure of customers who churned versus those who stayed.
```sql
SELECT 
	CASE 
    WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 'Churned Customers'
	ELSE 'Active Customers'
	END Customer_Status,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    AVG(Tenure) AS Avg_Tenure
FROM customer
GROUP BY Churn;
```


### B. Contract, Tenure & Billing Analysis
5.	Find the average monthly charges for churned customers compared to those who stayed.
```sql
SELECT 
    Contract AS Contract_Type,
    AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN MonthlyCharges END) AS Avg_MonthlyCharges_Churned,
    AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'No' THEN MonthlyCharges END) AS Avg_MonthlyCharges_Stayed
FROM customer
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY Contract_Type;
```

6.	Identify the most common contract type among churned customers.
```sql

    Contract Contract_Type,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY Churned_Customers DESC;
```

7.	Determine the churn rate for customers with different payment methods.
```sql
SELECT 
    PaymentMethod,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage

    AVG(CASE WHEN Churn = 'No' THEN tenure END) AS Avg_tenures_Stayed
FROM customer
GROUP BY Contract;
```

9.	Find the correlation between total charges and churn status (e.g., do higher spenders churn more or less?).
```sql
SELECT 
    Churn,
    AVG(TotalCharges) AS Avg_TotalCharges,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers
FROM customer
GROUP BY Churn
ORDER BY Churn DESC;

    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer
GROUP BY InternetService
ORDER BY Churn_Rate_Percentage DESC;
```

11.	Analyze how many churned customers had tech support services.

FROM customer
GROUP BY TechSupport
ORDER BY Churned_Customers DESC;
```

13.	Find out whether customers with multiple services (e.g., phone, internet, TV) are more or less likely to churn.
```sql
WITH cte1 AS(
			SELECT *,
				CASE 
					WHEN PhoneService = 'Yes' AND InternetService != 'No' 
						 AND (StreamingTV = 'Yes' OR StreamingMovies = 'Yes') 
					THEN 'Phone + Internet + TV' 
					WHEN PhoneService = 'Yes' AND InternetService != 'No' 
					THEN 'Phone + Internet' 
					WHEN InternetService != 'No' AND (StreamingTV = 'Yes' OR StreamingMovies = 'Yes') 
					THEN 'Internet + TV' 
					WHEN PhoneService = 'Yes' 
					THEN 'Phone Only' 
					WHEN InternetService != 'No' 
					THEN 'Internet Only' 
					ELSE 'No Services' 
				END AS Service_Category
			FROM customer
			)

SELECT 
	Service_Category,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM cte1
GROUP BY Service_Category
ORDER BY Churn_Rate_Percentage DESC;
```

13.	Determine the churn rate for customers with paperless billing versus those with mailed statements.
```sql

    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer
GROUP BY PaperlessBilling
ORDER BY Churn_Rate_Percentage DESC;
```
14.	Compare the churn rate of customers using fiber optic internet versus DSL or no internet service.
```sql
SELECT 
    InternetService,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Churn_Rate_Percentage
FROM customer
GROUP BY InternetService
ORDER BY Churn_Rate_Percentage DESC;
```


## üìä Visualization
To complement the SQL analysis, we visualized key insights using **Power BI**:
- **Churn Rate by Contract Type**: A bar chart shows that **month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn.
- **Churn Rate by Payment Method**: A pie chart highlights that **electronic check users** churn at a higher rate.
- **Churn Rate by Internet Service Type**: A stacked bar chart shows that **fiber optic users churn more** compared to DSL users.

## üìå Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following strategies could help reduce churn:
- **Encourage long-term contracts**: Offering discounts for annual or two-year contracts may help reduce churn.
- **Improve Fiber Optic service**: Investigate why fiber optic customers leave more frequently and address potential service issues.
- **Educate customers on payment options**: Providing incentives for bank transfers or auto-pay setups may reduce churn.
- **Enhance tech support services**: Customers with tech support churn less, so investing in better support could improve retention.

## üöÄ Future Work
- Implement **predictive modeling** using machine learning to identify high-risk churn customers.
- Conduct **A/B testing** on retention strategies to measure effectiveness.
- Expand the dataset with customer feedback to gain more qualitative insights.

## üí° Technologies Used
- **SQL** for data querying and analysis
- **Power BI** for data visualization
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** for advanced analytics (future work)

## üèÜ Conclusion
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to understanding customer churn in the telecom industry. By leveraging SQL and visualization tools, we identified key factors influencing churn and proposed actionable insights to improve retention rates.
